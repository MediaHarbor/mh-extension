# MediaHarbor Browser Extension

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the extensions/add-ons page of your browser (`chrome://extensions` for Chromium-based browsers or `about:addons` for Firefox).
3. Enable developer mode on Chromium-based browsers or go to `about:debugging` on Firefox-based browsers.
4. For Chromium-based browsers, click `Load unpacked` and select the cloned repository folder. For Firefox, click `Load Temporary Add-on` and select the `manifest.json` file.

## Usage

1. Navigate to a supported page (e.g., YouTube, Spotify, Tidal, Deezer).
2. Click the MediaHarbor extension icon in your browser's toolbar.
3. The extension will open a download popup in the MediaHarbor app.

## Future Plans

- Add a download arrow button for popular websites like YouTube, Spotify, Tidal, and Deezer.
- Develop a separate MediaHarbor service listener so users won't need to leave the browser to download content (still under consideration).
- Upload it to chrome and firefox add-on store
